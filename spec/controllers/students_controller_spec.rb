    # As your test suite grows, you might need more sample data to correctly
    # test your controllers. For example, when testing updating a student
    # your test object (student), will have to have been saved and you'll have
    # to compare the original student to the updated student and make sure the
    # correct updates occurred. Feel free to create more test objects as you need.

    # For all the tests of the student index, we need the following:
    # 1. To stub out that the Student::all to return our test object student.
    #    This means that our controller tests for the index will not actually
    #    call the ::all method on Student, but rather, stub it out, or fake it.
    #    It's nice if you can isolate your controller tests from the database.
    #    However, feel free to never use something like should_receive and 
    #    just use as many real objects as you want.

    # 2. It creates a mock web request to the route '/' so that our tests
    #    can check the response to that request through the Rack::Test provided
    #    method 'last_response', which will always mean the last response
    #    our test suite triggered.
